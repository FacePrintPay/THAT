To Whom It May Concern,

I am reaching out to your esteemed venture capital firm or group as a serial entrepreneur seeking experienced executives to join my board of directors and provide guidance in scaling my business. I am the founder of Cygel.Co/CyCo Cre8Tive, a cutting-edge technology company that I established in April 2022. My goal is to build long-term relationships with startups and small businesses, educating and coaching them on key fundamentals in owning and operating a business in the NEXGeN marketplace.
